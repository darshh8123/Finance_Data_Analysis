# Financial Loan Data Insights Dashboard
## Project Overview
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of a financial loan dataset. The project's primary goal was to transform raw data into actionable business intelligence, helping financial institutions and analysts make informed decisions regarding credit risk and loan portfolio management.

## Key Features & Visualizations
The interactive dashboard is built on a dark theme and is structured to provide an immediate overview and allow for in-depth analysis.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): The dashboard starts with prominent card visuals displaying high-level metrics such as Total Loan Amount, Average Interest Rate, and Total Loans. These KPIs provide an instant snapshot of the portfolio's health.

Loan Status Analysis: A central donut chart visualizes the distribution of loans by their status (Fully Paid, Charged Off, Current), immediately highlighting the overall health of the loan portfolio.

Risk and Interest Rate Analysis: A bar chart, "Sum of int_rate by sub_grade", is used to visualize the correlation between loan risk (represented by sub_grade) and the total interest rate, validating the risk assessment model.

Borrower Behavior: Several charts are dedicated to understanding borrower characteristics:

Total loans by Emp_length: A bar chart showing loan counts by employment length, revealing trends in borrower experience.

Sum of loan_amount by home_ownership: A bar chart comparing loan amounts across different home ownership statuses (e.g., MORTGAGE, RENT, OWN).

Time-Series Analysis: A line chart, "Total loans by issue_date", tracks loan issuance over time, providing crucial insights into market trends and the business cycle.

Interactive Filters: Slicers for Grade, Term, and Emp_length are provided to enable users to dynamically filter all visuals and explore specific segments of the data.

## Technical Skills & Tools
Power BI: Used for data modeling, DAX measure creation, and the design of all visualizations.
